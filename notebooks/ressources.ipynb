    "  \n",
    "## Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "- Look at the matplotlib [gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)! Pick the figure the is the close to what you want to achive and reuse the code\n",
    "- See [this blog post](http://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html) for some advices on how effectively using matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## Beyond matplotlib: visualization in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is only one (core) library among many other libraries, either built on top of matplotlib or using different technologies.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Some advices to effectively use Python...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online searching!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before writing any code, spend some time doing online searching to look for the right tool for solving your problem. There is a good chance\n",
    "that there already exists a specific tool that easily solves your problem. Searching for that might take some time, but it also save a lot of development time later!\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Googling\" can be also very efficient when you know which tool to use but you don't know yet how to use it for your problem. Be specific, start including the name of the tool in your search query, e.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "numpy <do x>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, try to explain `<do x>` as succint and precise as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: search results may quickly lead you on platforms like [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read the official docs and docstrings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the code documentation! Either online documentation, or directly from the code, i.e., \"docstrings\" (e.g., in the notebook:\n",
    "autocompletion with TAB, docstrings tooltip with Shift-TAB).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write idiomatic python code:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python](http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html)\n",
    "- [Code style](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/style/)  (part of Hitchhiker's Guide to Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing and publishing code: good practices\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of good practices are well explained in the paper below. I think that the most important is: write code for humans, i.e., your colleagues and also including your future yourself. This is more important than writing code for the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Best Practices for Scientific Computing](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745)\n",
    "- Check also this [blog post](http://allendowney.blogspot.de/2018/02/the-six-stages-of-computational-science.html) by Allen Downey, author of several books for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are tools in Python for automatically checking the code quality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/): framework for automated unit tests\n",
    "- [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/): check potential mistakes and code style\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an \"official\", widely adopted style guide for Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to publish the code, i.e., make it publicly available (open-source), you should choose a license.\n",
