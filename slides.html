# Get started with scientific Python

### Potsdam (February 7-9, 2018)

Beno√Æt Bovy - GFZ, section 5.5

---

## Small survey

First, let's have a look at the
[results](https://goo.gl/forms/ml9DTZLQaYyNgl4U2) of the survey...

---

## The Scientific Python learning curve

--

The Python language is easy to learn.

--

But the Python scientific "ecosystem" is very large and rich.

--

This is challenging for newcomers.

--

<br><br>
The Python scientific ecosystem provides many high-level, easy-to-use tools.

--

But harnessing the potential of these powerful tools often requires good
understanding of some abstract concepts.

--

This may be also challenging for new users.

---

## Goals of this short course

--

Introduce a few "pythonic" concepts and idioms.

--

Give a broad (though rather shallow) overview of the scientific ecosystem.

--

Give some tricks, advices and good practices to efficiently write efficient code.

--

<br>
<br>
.highlight[Hopefully, you will get answers to these questions]

--
- Where to start?

--
- Where can I find the right tool(s) for my problem?

--
- Where can I look for further help and information?

--
- Isn't Python too slow?


---

## The origin of Python

.col-right60[
Python is not new at all, it was created more than 25 years ago by Guido van Rossum.

Python (CPython) is a community-based, open-source project managed by the
Python Software Foundation.
]

## The language vs. its implementation

The name "Python" refers to the language, which is independent from
its implementation (software).

--

Python is actually implemented in different languages.

name        | language
----------- | --------
CPython     | C
Jython      | Java
IronPython  | C#
PyPy        | just-in-time compilation

--

CPython is the reference and most used implementation.

--

The Python scientific libraries are built almost exclusively on top of CPython.

--

Therefore, hereafter we use "Python" to refer to both the language and the CPython
implementation.

## The rise of Python

Python has slowly gained popularity over the years with a recent high increase, especially
[within the scientific community](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/14/python-growing-quickly/).

## Why is Python popular?

Scientific work involves a whole range of different computational tasks.

This doesn't happen with Python.

---

## Why is Python popular?

Clean syntax, readable code

- **Accessible to non computer scientists**

--

High level, interpreted language

- **Faster development (less to maintain, no compilation)**

--

Platform independent code, batteries included, easily extensible,
robust core scientific librairies + great number of librairies around

- **Reuse instead of reinvent**

--

Multi-paradigm (imperative, object-oriented, functional)

- **Suited for writing small scripts as well as large applications**

## Python weaknesses

--

.highlight[Python is slow ]

- Workaround: call compiled code from within Python
- This does not always matter! "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"

--

.highlight[Python 2 vs. Python 3]

- No forward nor backward compatibility
- Python 3 has been released a while ago, but then has been slowly adopted
- Unless you have no choice, [use Python 3!](http://www.python3statement.org/)

--

.highlight[The ecosystem is rapidly and constantly evolving]

- Continuous maintenance work

# How to install Python?

---

## How to install Python?

Python is already installed on many platforms (linux distros, macos...) üòÄ

--

But we'll also need to install Python scientific libraries üòÆ

- Possibly including non-Python dependencies
- May not be compatible with the system version

--

There are many ways to install Python (CPython) + libraries ü§î

- Plateform-specific package managers (apt, homebrew)
- Cross-platform package managers (conda, pip)
- Python distributions (Enthought, PythonXY)
- Compiling the sources (...really?)

--

My advice üòâ

- use conda!
- (and pip when a package cannot be installed using conda)

---

## Conda

.highlight[How to install conda?]

- Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) (Full distribution)
- Or download and install [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) (Minimal installation)

--

.highlight[What are the advantages of using conda?]

- Cross-platform
- A lot of packages available for scientific development
- Not only for Python
- Isolated envrionments!
  - Different versions of Python/libraries may coexist on the same system
- Works with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/#)

--

.highlight[Useful ressources]:

- [Conda documentation](https://conda.io/docs/) (including tutorials)
- For geeks: read
[this blog post](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2016/08/25/conda-myths-and-misconceptions/)

.terminal[
```
$ python

.terminal[
```
$ python myscript.py
```
]

## How Jupyter works?

.col-left40[
It decouple the interface and the code exectution

Code can be executed remotely!

Initially for Python (IPython), but language agnostic
(R, Julia, Octave... even C++ or Fortran)
